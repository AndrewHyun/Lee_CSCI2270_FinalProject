Battleship

This program is a single player battleship game where the user is prompted to guess coordinates of spots on the grid to find enemy ships.  There is no one playing against the user.  Rather, the goal is to find all the ships in the least amount of moves possible.

How to run:
Run the file through Code Blocks/Terminal and the user will be shown a menu explaining the game.
X = Hit
0 = Miss
~ = Sea

Dependencies:
- Terminal

System Requirements:
- Can run on any system as long as they have a mode of running the code

Open issues/bugs:
When a character that isn't a number is entered for the rows/columns, the program freezes or gets stuck at the "press any key to continue" option.
